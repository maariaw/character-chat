# Character Chatter

Web app for playing out discussions between characters of a tabletop or virtual role playing game. Game masters (GM) can set up chats and invite players to have discussions in-character.

Sometimes role playing campaigns are packed full of action, but leave little time for characters and their friendships to develop. Do you ever wonder, what your characters would actually have said to each other, when they first met? What stories would be shared around the campfire at night? What did they talk about on that long ride you skipped over to get to the next battle? With this app, those scenes can be played out between sessions, with no pressure for everyone to be available at the same time.
