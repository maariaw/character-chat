# Character Chatter

Character Chatter is a web app for playing out discussions between characters of a tabletop or virtual role playing game. Game masters (GM) can set up chats and invite players to have discussions in-character.

Sometimes role playing campaigns are packed full of action, but leave little time for characters and their friendships to develop. Do you ever wonder, what your characters would actually have said to each other, when they first met? What stories would be shared around the campfire at night? What did they talk about on that long ride you skipped over to get to the next battle? With this app, those scenes can be played out between sessions, with no pressure for everyone to be available at the same time.

This app with the above features was built as an assignment for Databases Lab course.

This was my first proper project done with Python, and my first time using Flask and Heroku, too. I followed an example
project, learning how to adapt and implement the tools to my own project. It was also good practice in prioritizing features
and adding them incrementally.
